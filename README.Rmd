# Data Analysis and Visualisation Exercises Using R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The following exercises are aimed at aiding the learner use R for performing some types of data analysis and visualisation techniques that are illustrative of various approaches useful in most data projects.

For each exercise, the learner is expected to create either an R script or an R Markdown document to perform the tasks requested.

## Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement

This exercise is based on:

Bland, J. M. & Altman, DouglasG. Statistical Methods For Assessing Agreement Between Two Methods Of Clinical Measurement.  Lancet 327, 307â€“310 (1986).

The dataset used in the paper can be accessed from the `teaching_datasets` repository. The URL to the `.dat` file is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxfordIHTM/teaching_datasets/main/ba.dat.

The `ba` dataset contains peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurements (in litres per minute) taken with a **Wright peak flow metre** (Wright) and a **Mini-Wright peak flow metre** (Mini-Wright). This is the same data that is presented in the referenced Lancet article above.

For this exercise, use the R script and/or R Markdown titled `exercise1`.

### Tasks:

1. Read the `ba.dat` dataset from the GitHub URL provided above.

2. Create a function that will calculate the following metrics required by the **Bland and Altman plot** as described in the article referenced above:

    a. Mean of the per subject measurements made by the **Wright** and the **Mini-Wright**;
    
    b. Difference between the per subject measurements made by the **Wright** and the **Mini-Wright**;
    
    c. Mean of the difference between the per subject measurements made by the **Wright** and the **Mini-Wright**; and,
    
    d. Lower and upper limits of agreement between the per subject measurements made by the **Wright** and the **Mini-Wright**.
    
3. Create a function that creates a **Bland and Altman plot** as described in the article.

4. Create a short report that shows

    a. A table of the mean and difference of per subject measurements made by the **Wright** and the **Mini-Wright**;
    
    b. A **Bland and Altman plot**; and,
    
    c. A short discussion of the findings with regard to the agreement between the **Wright** and **Mini-Wright** tools.
    

## Performing tests for correlations and associations between variables

This exercise uses the `fem.dat` dataset accessible from the `teaching_datasets` repository. The URL to the `.dat` file is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxfordIHTM/teaching_datasets/main/fem.dat. The `fem.dat` dataset is from 118 female pyschiatric patients.

The variables in the dataset are:

**Variable Name** | **Variable Description**
:--- | :---
ID | Patient ID
AGE | Age in years
IQ | IQ score
ANX | Anxiety (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe)
DEP | Depression (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate or severe)
SLP | Sleeping normally (1 = yes, 2 = no)
SEX |	Lost interest in sex (1 = yes, 2 = no)
LIFE | Considered suicide (1 = yes, 2 = no)
WT | Weight change (kg) in previous 6 months

For this exercise, use the R script and/or R Markdown titled `exercise2`.

### Tasks

1. Read the `fem.dat` dataset from the GitHub URL provided above;

2. Get a summary of the variables for `AGE`, `IQ`, and `WT` using tabular and graphical methods;

3. Test the correlation between weight gain (`WT`), age in years (`AGE`), and IQ (`IQ`) graphically and through formal statistical tests;

4. Calculate the odds ratio of someone with any form of anxiety considering suicide and calculate the odds ratio of someone with any for of depression considering suicide;

6. Specify a logistic regression model that looks into the correlation/association of considering suicide (`LIFE`) with depression (`DEP`), anxiety (`ANX`), abnormal sleep (`SLP`), and loss of interest in sex (`SEX`); and,

7. Create a short report that shows

    a. A tabular and graphical summary of the `AGE`, `IQ`, and `WT` variables;
    
    b. Results of correlation test between weight gain (`WT`), age in years (`AGE`), and IQ (`IQ`);
    
    c. Odds ratio of considering suicide and anxiety and odds ratio of considering suicde and depression; and,
    
    d. Results of logstic regression model for considering suicide with depression (`DEP`), anxiety (`ANX`), abnormal sleep (`SLP`), and loss of interest in sex (`SEX`).


## Performing text mining and topic modelling

This exercise uses the text data on COVID-related resolutions issued from 28 January 2020 to 30 July 2020 by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) in the Philippines.

The data is accessible through the [`covidphtext` package](https://github.com/como-ph/covidphtext) available from GitHub.

To install this package, you will first need to install the `remotes` package:

```R
install.packages("remotes")
```

and then install the `covidphtext` package from GitHub as follows:

```R
remotes::install_github("como-ph/covidphtext")
```

Once installed, the full IATF resolutions dataset can be obtained by

```R
library(covidphtext)
iatf_data <- combine_iatf()
```

For this exercise, use the R script and/or R Markdown titled `exercise3`.

### Tasks

1. What is the general trend of sentiments expressed in the various resolutions over time?

2. What are the most common words (by sentiment) used in the various resolutions?

3. What general themes can be elicited from the various resolutions in the dataset? How do these themes relate to the general approach taken by the Philippine government nationally to manage the COVID-19 pandemic?

4. Create a short report that shows

    a. various relevant plots of sentiment trend over time;
    
    b. various relevant plots and tables showing term frequency; and,
    
    c. various relevant plots and tables showing topics modelled from the resolutions.
